# InfoCard

![Demo of InfoCard](https://github.com/jdsmith022/InfoCard/blob/master/git_images/info0.gif)

## Description
Quick project to play with layout of info card as an internship project for CO2ok.

I did not have time to fully alter and test the layout or play around with different layout ideas.

I tried to create a separate library that would hold the InfoCard to but added into this project as a plugin, but I was having issue with getting the images to show properly, so for lack of time, I abandoned that. (With the intension to resolve later).
